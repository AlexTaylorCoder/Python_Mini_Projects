To share all enviornment variables of root director with subdirectories will need to launch script from root, because enviornment variables cannot be accessed with relative path

When using beautiful soup selectors try to be specific as possible to reduce the amount of searching through the HTML. Will greatly increase performance. Also keep in mind
that headers can be used to "fake" being human like...

headers = {
    #This spoofs the browser and language 
    "User-Agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Accept-Language":"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"
}
